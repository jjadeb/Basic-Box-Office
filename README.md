## A ticket buying system



My goal is to create a simple ticket buying system for a small
theatre company that does all their transactions via cash. In other 
words, there won't be any money transaction built into the system.

In this program, ticket sellers will be able to create 
customer profiles, sell them tickets to different shows, and add 
them to the list of patrons seeing the respective shows.

This project is of interest to me because I **love** theatre and 
would love a small taste of what it is like to create the systems
that theatre companies use.
